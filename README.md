# What is MIDAS-VT?
MIDAS Virtual Tester, MIDAS-VT, is a software package that virtually analyses homogenous and heterogenous material test experiments. MIDAS-VT is capable of predicting viscoelastic behavior and crack propagation in smaples.
The current version is able to simulate the following test configurations.

# What is MIDAS-VT-Pre?
MIDAS Virtual Tester Preprocessor, MIDAS-VT-Pre, is a part of MIDAS-VT package. MIDAS-VT-Pre generate Finite Element model of the test samples.
Overall flow of MIDAS-VT-Pre is shown below. MIDAS-VT-Pre gives two options:  
* Case I: generates the FE model directly from the sample image or sample geometry  
* Case II: to add cohessive elemnets into regular FE mesh which is generated in advance
